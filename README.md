# Cloud Tetris

Play Tetris right in your browser against one other person, a (hopefully) accurate imitation of the NES version

Features Missing
----------------
1. Next Piece
2. Piece Statistics
3. Scoring
4. Good Multiplayer

Features Planned
----------------
1. Room based multiplayer
    * A CHALLENGER APPROACHES! Enter a room with another player and they'll be prompted of your joining.
    You can wait for them to finish, or they can start a new game and all players in the room will compete for
    a high score.
2. Lobby System
3. Controller Support!?!?!?
